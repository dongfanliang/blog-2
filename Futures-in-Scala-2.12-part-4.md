# Futures in Scala 2.12 (part 4)

This is the fourth of several posts describing the evolution of `scala.concurrent.Future` in Scala `2.12.x`.
For the previous post, [click here](https://github.com/viktorklang/blog/blob/master/Futures-in-Scala-2.12-part-3.md).

## Missing canonical combinators: transformWith

As we saw in the previous post, `transform` provides a nice unification of both `map` and `recover` on `Future`, and I know what you're thinking now: "What about `flatMap` and `recoverWith`?"

Say no more! `transformWith` is the answer, and has the following lovely signature:

~~~scala
def transformWith[S](f: Try[T] => Future[S])(implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Future[S]
~~~

Remember to use the solution with the least power which will suffice for the task at hand, so prefer to use the `flatMap`s and the `recoverWith`s primarily, opting for the `transformWith` as required.

And, before you say anything, yes, `flatMap` and `recoverWith` are implemented in terms of `transformWith` in Scala 2.12!

EDIT:

Here's `flatMap`:

~~~scala
def flatMap[S](f: T => Future[S])(implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Future[S] = transformWith {
    case Success(s) => f(s)
    case Failure(_) => this.asInstanceOf[Future[S]] //Safe cast to reuse current, failed, Future
  }
~~~

And here's `recoverWith`:

~~~scala
 def recoverWith[U >: T](pf: PartialFunction[Throwable, Future[U]])(implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Future[U] =
    transformWith {
      case Failure(t) => pf.applyOrElse(t, (_: Throwable) => this) //Pass along current failure if no match
      case Success(_) => this
    }
~~~

### Benefits:

1. Ultimate power, for when you require it
